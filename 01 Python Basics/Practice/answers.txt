1. The operators are +, -, *, and /. The values are 'hello', -88.8, and 5.
2. The variable is spam; the string is 'spam'. Strings always start and end
with quotes.
3. The three data types introduced in this chapter are integers, floatingpoint
numbers, and strings.
4. An expression is a combination of values and operators. All expressions
evaluate (that is, reduce) to a single value.
5. An expression evaluates to a single value. A statement does not.
6. The bacon variable is set to 20. The bacon + 1 expression does not
reassign the value in bacon (that would need an assignment statement:
bacon = bacon + 1).
7. Both expressions evaluate to the string 'spamspamspam'.
8. Variable names cannot begin with a number.
9. The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer,
floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.
10. The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only
strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator. The
correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'.
